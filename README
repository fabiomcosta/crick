# Crick - real event simulator

Crick is a browser event simulator, that really fires the event from the browser.

It currently only works on firefox.

All mouse and keyboard events are supported right now.
Events like "submit" should work too but are still not tested.

## how to use

Check the tests to see how to use it.
