# Crick - real event simulator

Crick is a browser event simulator, that really fires the event from the browser (adds letters onkeypress into text inputs for example).

All mouse and keyboard events are supported right now.
Events like "submit" should work too but are still not tested.

## how to use

Check the tests to see how to use it.

## browsers supported

It currently only works on firefox, because i couldn't fire real events on other browsers.
